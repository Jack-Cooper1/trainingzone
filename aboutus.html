<div class="lecclash"><p>Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training:</p>
Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it:<ul>
<li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. </li>
<li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </li>
<li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. </li>
<li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:</li> <ul id="ull">
	<li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
	<li>Which one are you most on top of? </li>
	<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? </li></ul>
	<li>Don't ask your lecturer "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li></div>
</ul>
